This project introduces a cutting-edge approach to knowledge retrieval through the development of a Multi-PDF GPT Generative Q&A System. Harnessing the powerful capabilities of GooglePaLM2 and LangChain technologies, our system seamlessly navigates multiple PDF documents, extracting relevant information, and generating context-aware answers to user queries. By leveraging advanced large language models (LLM) this system not only enhances traditional search methodologies but also opens new dimensions in understanding and interpreting textual data. The integration of GooglePaLM2 and LangChain contributes to the efficiency and accuracy of the question-answer generation process, creating a robust and dynamic tool for information synthesis and retrieval. This project marks a significant stride in the realm of generative artificial intelligence and information processing, promising transformative implications for diverse fields that rely on efficient data interpretation and knowledge extraction from PDF documents.
