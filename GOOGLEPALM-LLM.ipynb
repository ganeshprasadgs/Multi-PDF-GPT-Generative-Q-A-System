In today’s world ROBOTICS is fast growing and \\ninteresting field. It is simplest way for latest technology modification. Now a day’s \\ncommunication is part of advancement of technology, so I decided to work on ROBOTICS \\nfield, and design something which will make human life simpler in today aspect. An \\nautonomous robot is a robot that can move on its own in an unknown and unstructured \\nenvironment. An autonomous robot is equipped with software intelligence to sense its \\nenvironment, detect obstacles in its path and move around an unknown environment \\novercoming the obstacles. There are many robotic designs that are employed in designing of \\nautonomous robots. These designs are usually developed considering the physical \\nenvironment in which the robot must be deployed. There are autonomous robots like snake \\nrobots, walking robots, autonomous drones and autonomous robotic cars or rovers. This \\nROBOT has sufficient intelligence to cover the maximum area of provided space. It \\nhas an infrared sensor which are used to sense the obstacles coming in between the path of \\nROBOT. It will move in a particular direction and avoid the obstacle which is coming in its \\npath. The main motto of designing such type of Robot or the technology is that this \\ntechnology can be used in today’s very fast transportation to avoid the accident generally \\nhappen in congested by applying emergency break. If we use this technology in the car or \\nany vehicle, it will automatically sense the obstacles then it will take a side to the available \\nfree space. An obstacle may be a living thing or any object. Autonomous Intelligent Robots \\nare robots that can perform desired tasks in unstructured environments without continuous \\nhuman guidance. Thus, by using this technology in vehicles we make the drive safe. \\n \\n\\uf0d8 THE MAIN OBJECTIVES:  \\n \\nThe main objectives of the project are comprehended as follows: \\n\\uf076 The obstacle avoidance robot is able to move around in an unknown environment \\nwithout colliding with surrounding objects. \\n\\uf076 The robot would have the capacity to detect obstacles in its path based on a \\npredetermined threshold distance. \\n\\uf076 After obstacle detection, the robot would change its course to a relatively open path \\nby making autonomous decision. \\n\\uf076 It would require no external control during its operation. \\n\\uf076 It can measure the distance between itself and the surrounding objects in real-time. \\n\\uf076 It would be able to operate effectively in unknown environment. \\n\\uf076 Obstacle avoiding robots can be used in almost all mobile robot navigation systems \\n\\uf076 They can be used for household work like automatic vacuum cleaning. \\n\\uf076 They can also be used in dangerous environments, where human penetration could be \\nfatal.

It is the intelligence exhibited by software or machines. The \\ncentral goals of artificial intelligence research include knowledge, reasoning, learning, \\nplanning, perception, the ability to manipulate and move objects and natural language \\nprocessing. \\nThe field was founded on the claim that a central property of humans is intelligence, and that \\nit can be sufficiently well described to the extent that a machine can simulate it. \\n \\n\\uf0d8 ROBOTICS AND ROBOTS:  \\nIt is a branch of technology and deals with designing, construction, operation, and \\napplication of robots. It also deals with the computer systems for their sensory, control, \\ninformation processing and feedback. These technologies deal with automated machines that \\ncan replace humans in manufacturing processes or dangerous environments. These robots \\nresemble humans in behavior, appearance, and/or cognition. Robotics requires a working \\nknowledge of \\nmechanics, electronics, and software. Robots are machines and are of a wide range. The \\ncommon feature of robots is their capability to move. They perform physical tasks. Robots \\nhave many different forms. They range from industrial robots, whose appearance is dictated \\nby the function they are to perform. Or they can be humanoid robots, which mimic the \\nhuman movement and our form. \\nRobots can be grouped generally as: \\n\\uf076 Manipulator robots (for e.g., industrial robots) \\n\\uf076 Mobile robots (for e.g., autonomous vehicles), \\n\\uf076 Self-reconfigurable robots, the robots that can conform themselves to the task at hand. \\nRobots may act according to their own decision-making ability, provided by artificial \\nintelligence or may be controlled directly by a human, such as remotely controlled bomb \\ndisposal robots and robotic arms; or. However, most robots fall in between these extremes, \\nbeing controlled by pre-programmed computers. \\n \\n\\uf0d8 ROBOT WORKING: \\n \\nHuman beings on a basic level are made of five major components: \\n\\uf076 A muscle system that can move the body structure \\n\\uf076 A body structure itself \\n\\uf076 A power source that can activate the muscles and sensors \\n\\uf076 A sensory system which can receive information about the body and the \\nsurrounding environment.  \\n\\uf076 A brain system which can process sensory information and tell the muscles what to do. \\nRobots are made up of the same components as above. A typical autonomous robot has a \\nsensor system, a movable physical structure, a power supply and a computer brain that ', metadata={'source': 'Project.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content=\"controls all these elements. Basically, robots are man-made versions of the animal life. They \\nare machines that can replicate human and animal behaviour. \\n \\n\\uf0d8 THE ACTUATOR: \\n \\nAll robots have a movable body (almost all). Some have motorized wheels only, while others \\nmay have a dozen of movable parts (that are typically made of plastic or metal). Like bones \\nin a human body, the individual segments are connected together with the help of joints. \\nRobots use actuators to spin wheels and jointed pivot. Some robots use solenoids and electric \\nmotors as actuators; others some use a pneumatic system (a system driven by compressed \\ngases); yet others use a hydraulic system. A robot may even use all of these actuator types \\ntogether. Robots need a power source to be able to drive the actuators. Most robots have a \\nbattery or they plug into an electricity source. Pneumatic robots need air compressors or \\ncompressed air tanks and hydraulic robots need a pump that pressurizes the hydraulic fluid. \\nThe actuators are wired to an electrical circuit. The circuit powers these electrical motors and \\nsolenoids directly. It also activates the hydraulic system by manipulating electrical valves. \\nThe valves determine the pressurized fluid's path through the machine. \\n \\n \\n\\uf0d8 ROBOT LEARNING:  \\n \\nRobot learning is an intersecting research field between robotics and machine learning. It \\nstudies techniques that allow robots to acquire skills and adapt to its environment by learning \\nvarious algorithms. Learning can take place either by self-exploration or through guidance \\nlike in robot learning that learns by imitation. \\n \\n\\uf0d8 AUTONOMOUS ROBOT:  \\n \\nAutonomous robots are independent of any controller and can act on their own. The robot is \\nprogrammed to respond in a particular way to an outside stimulus. The bump-and-go robot is \\na good example. This robot uses bumper sensors to detect obstacle. When the robot is turned \\non, it moves in a straight direction and when it hits an obstacle, the crash triggers its bumper \\nsensor. The robot gives a programming instruction that asks the robot to back up, turn to the \\nright direction and move forward. This is its response to every bump. In this way, the robot \\ncan change direction every time, it encounters an obstacle. A more elaborate version of the \\nsame idea is used by more advanced robots. Roboticists create new sensor systems and \\nalgorithms to make robots more perceptive and smarter. Today, robots can effectively \\nnavigate a variety of environments. Obstacle avoidance can be implemented as a reactive \\ncontrol law whereas path planning involves the precomputation of an obstacle-free path \\nwhich a controller will then guide a robot along. Some mobile robots also use various \\nultrasound sensors to see obstacles or infrared. These sensors work in a similar fashion to \\nanimal echolocation. The robot sends out a beam of infrared light or a sound signal. It then \\ndetects the reflection of the signal. The robot locates this distance to the obstacles depending \\non how long it takes the signal to bounce back. Some advanced robots also use stereo vision. \\nTwo cameras provide robots with depth perception. Image recognition software then gives \\nthem the ability to locate, classify various objects. Robots also use smell and sound sensors \\nto gain knowledge about its surroundings. More advanced robots can analyse unfamiliar \", metadata={'source': 'Project.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

This kind of \\nrobots can associate terrain patterns with actions.  \\n \\n\\uf0d8 ARDUINO OVERVIEW:  \\n \\nArduino is a popular programmable board used to create projects. It consists of a simple \\nhardware platform as well as a free source code editor which has a “one click compiles or \\nupload” feature. Hence it is designed in way that one can use it without necessarily being an \\nexpert programmer (Kushner 1987). Arduino offers an open-source electronic prototyping \\nplatform that is easy to use and flexible for both the software and hardware. Arduino is able \\nto sense the environment through receiving input from several sensors. It is also able to \\ncontrol its surrounding through controlling motors, lights and other actuators. \\nThe Arduino programming language that is based on the wiring and the Arduino \\ndevelopment environment that is based on the processing are used to program the \\nmicrocontroller found on the board (Bansi, 2005). Due to its open-source environment, one \\ncan easily write and upload codes to the I/O board.

To make the robot move right, the right motor stays \\nstationary and left motor rotates clockwise, hence robot takes a right turn.  \\n \\n\\uf076 When one of the Infrared sensors (say the one located at the left side) senses a black \\npath while the other one (right one) senses a white path, then the path is turning \\ntowards left, hence the robot moves left. To make the robot move left, the left motor \\nstays stationary and right motor rotates clockwise, hence robot takes a left turn.  \\n \\n\\uf076 To take a sharp right turn, make the left motor rotate clockwise while making the right \\nmotor rotate anticlockwise. To take a sharp left turn, make the right motor rotate \\nclockwise while making the left motor rotate anticlockwise.  \\n \\n\\uf076 When the ultrasonic sensor in front of the robot senses any obstruction (in \\nprogrammed range) while moving forward then the motors stops rotating and the robot \\nstops. The robot starts moving as soon as the obstruction is removed. \\n \\n \\n \", metadata={'source': 'Project.pdf', 'page': 12})]"
